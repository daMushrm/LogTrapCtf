# Challenge Description

- This is a **black box** challenge.
- Difficulty: **Medium**
- To simulate an admin viewing messages, go to `/visit.html`.
- Please do not look at the source code of `/visit.html`; it is out of the challenge scope (and I was lazy to make a headless browser script).

# To run

In the same directory run

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

---

**IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind that the challenge lack lots of stuff like a propper Dockerfile and headless browser script to simulate admin viewing messages, also it may contain some errors

> sorry for the poor development :D
